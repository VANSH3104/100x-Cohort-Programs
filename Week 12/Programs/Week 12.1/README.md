# Deploying Frontends to AWS

## Introduction

When deploying an app, mostly two things are needed to be handled:

1. Distribution
2. Storage

## What is AWS S3?

A cloud storage service which handles the storage of large media/static files.

## What is AWS CloudFront?

Content Delivery Network (CDN) by AWS which handles the distribution of media/static files.
We need it cause distributing files from a single server can be slow and expensive.

## Uploading our App to S3

> Note: By frontend, we mean static HTML, CSS, JS files. We can't deploy a backend or app using server-side rendering (Next.js) to S3.

1. **Build the React App**. Go to the `react-app` directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. Open the AWS account. Search for S3.

3. Name the bucket and select the region. Click on `Create bucket`.

    Scroll to the bottom and click on `Create bucket`. <br>

5. Copy the `dist` folder from the `react-app` directory to the S3 bucket.

6. Once uploaded, we will be able to see the files in the bucket.<br>

## Setting up CloudFront

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and search for CloudFront. Click on `Create Distribution`.

2. In the origin, you can put any url as the source of truth. We will put the S3 bucket url.<br>

> Note: For origin path, put the name of the folder in the S3 bucket where the files are stored.

3. For **Origin Access**, we select `Origin access control settings (recommended)` and create a new OAC.<br>

> Note: By Origin Access, 'Cloudfront' asks for a way to access the files in the S3 bucket. By default, we restricted public access to our bucket.

4. Set the `default root object` to `index.html`. <br>

5. After its creation, we need to put the OAC we get in the S3 bucket's permission.

6. Copy the policy generated, Go to the S3 bucket, click on `Permissions` and `Bucket Policy`. Paste the policy and save it.<br>

8. Once done, Go to the newly created CloudFront distribution page, copy the domain name and paste it in the browser.
