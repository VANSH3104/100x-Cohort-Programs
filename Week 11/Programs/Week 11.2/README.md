## What is AWS & Why is it better?

In simple words, it is a cloud services provider. We can get a remote server from here.

The main benefit which matters for us is that we can deploy a express app here which was not possible on Cloudflare workers.


## 1. How to get the EC2 instance?

1. Create an account on AWS. (a credit card is required).
2. Search EC2 in the search bar.

6. Fill in the fields:
   - Give a name to the instance

   - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Here we are selecting `Amazon Linux 2023 AMI` (eligible for free tier)

   - Choose an Instance Type (Default is: t2.micro for minimum cost)

   - Create your seperate key pair (download the .pem file). This is used for a secure connection between your computer and the server.

   - Inside Network Settings, we create a security group with following settings:

     - Allow SSH (port 22) from anywhere
     - Allow HTTP (port 80) for everyone
     - Allow HTTPS (port 3000) for everyone

   - Review and Launch

7. Check back on the EC2 dashboard, you will see your instance running.
   <img width="1214" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-11 at 7 36 02 PM" src="https://github.com/its-id/100x-Cohort-Programs/assets/60315832/45055ee4-2c72-4fae-897f-8c5c51eba1f0">

## 2. How to connect to the EC2 instance?

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your .pem file is located.
   <br>
2. Run the following command to change the permissions of the .pem file:

   ```bash
    chmod 700 your-key-pair.pem
   ```

   > **For Windows**, check this [discussion](https://superuser.com/questions/1296024/windows-ssh-permissions-for-private-key-are-too-open) or install [putty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html).

   <details>
    <summary>Explaining the above command</summary>

   - `chmod` is a command used to change the permissions of a file or directory.

   - `700` is the permission code. It means that the owner can **read, write and execute** the file, but no one else can do anything with it.
   </details>
   <br>

3. Now, you can connect to the instance using the following command:

   ```bash
    ssh -i "your-key-pair.pem" xxxxxxxx@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

   where `your-key-pair.pem` is the name of your .pem file and xxxxxxxxx@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is the public DNS of your instance.

   **To see the public DNS**

   - Click on your instance in the EC2 dashboard.

   - Click on `Connect` button on top.

   - Navigate to the `SSH Client` tab. There you will see the example command, either copy the whole command or just the public DNS part.

## 3. How to deploy your application on the EC2 instance?

1. Once you are connected to the instance, run the following commands:

```bash
 sudo yum update -y
 sudo yum install git -y
 git clone https://github.com/its-id/100x-Cohort-Programs.git
 cd 100x-Cohort-Programs/Week\ 11/Programs/Week\ 11.2
 sudo yum install nodejs -y
 sudo yum install npm -y
 npm install
 node index.js
```

where `https://github.com/its-id/100x-Cohort-Programs.git` is the url of this repository, you can replace it with your own repository url and cd into your own directory.

2. Check if your app is running by visiting your public DNS in the browser.

   **Route**: `http://your-public-dns:8080/todos`

> **Note**: Since we are running the app on port 8080, we need to add the port number as a custom TCP rule in the security group settings.

## 4. How to enable Reverse Proxy?

### What it does?

Basically helps you rent a single server and host multiple websites on it. Best way to make one web server handle multiple domains (if you are cheap like me ðŸ˜…).

1. Install nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y nginx
   ```
   <br>
2. Create a reverse proxy:

   - Open the nginx configuration file:

     ```bash
     sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     ```

   - Replace the contents of the file with the following:

     ```bash
     events {
         # Event directives...
     }

     # for pointing to multiple domains
        http {
            server {
            listen 80;
            server_name [YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_1];

                location / {
                    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
                    proxy_http_version 1.1;
                    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;
                    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
                }
            }

            server {
            listen 80;
            server_name [YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_2];

                location / {
                    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
                    proxy_http_version 1.1;
                    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;
                    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
                }
            }
        }
     ```

     > Make sure to replace `[YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_1]` and `[YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_2]` with your own domain names.

   - Save and exit the file by pressing `esc` and then `:wq` and then `enter`.
     <br>

3. Restart nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo service nginx restart
   ```
